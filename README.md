### Application Goals

The goal of the NPO Geo Finder application is to give users an application by which they can find an NPO item (for example: a news fragment, a documentary, episode of a television program) based on a location. The user is prompted to insert a location (for example: Amsterdam) and receives a list of the most proximate NPO items to that location.

Supplementary features: A extra option where users can filter a NPO program (for example: "KRO") and get all locations on a map associated with that broadcaster.
						Another filter options allows user to filter a specific time period.

**What features will be exposed to the end user, what problem will be solved for the user.**

The user can search for NPO items based on a location. The general problem that will be solved for the user is that an NPO item can also be found based on location and not only based on date (as it happens now on "uitzendinggemist.nl").
