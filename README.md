# NPO GeoFinder 
#### (Programmeerproject Juni 2015)


### Application Goal

The goal of the NPO Geo Finder application is to give users a  tool by which they can find an NPO item (for example: a news fragment, a documentary, episode of a television program) based on a location. The user is prompted to insert a location (for example: Amsterdam) and receives a list of the most proximate NPO items to that location. The application uses the recently published NPO API by which extensive data associated with NPO items can be obtained.

Extra Supplementary features: A extra option where users can filter a NPO program (for example: "Tegenlicht") and get all locations on a map associated with that program. 
The same sort of filter could be implemented with different television stations ("de omroepen").
